
2/3 of the solution depends on how well the problem is described and explained.

If the problem is not properly understood or poorly explained the solution will be bad.

An excellent code given the wrong problem will produce excellent code that is useless.


More time is needed to understand a problem.

- Working on the design and interface of a solution will help developers get a better appreciation of the problem and intricacies.

- Working on the unit and performance tests will help ensure the code is simple and fast to use. (especially the public API.)

- Once all the above is done working the implementation should be straight forward and rewarding.
