
Goal
=======

Keep documentation simple.

- Information on Github's [documentation sytem](https://github.com/blog/1939-how-github-uses-github-to-document-github)
- Very simple and elegant system: [ditto](https://github.com/chutsu/ditto)
- More feature rich but sligthly more complex [mkdocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/)
- Documentation for Code: http://sharpdox.de/en/

Ideal solution would be sharpdox and ditto.

Idea for a desktop application
---------------------

### Personal Knowledge Management System (PKMS)

Build something like [wikiPad](http://wikidpad.sourceforge.net/) using the same concepts as FG.

- Folder structure. (Create md files in the folder you want)
- Automatically renders md files
- Publish to github (Can select which individual pages to publish.)
- Everything stored in git
- Inbuilt search
- Possible WYSIWYG to markdown editor
- Allow users to use whichever markup language they want. markdown, textile, Creole etc...

### ToDo List application

Something similar to WorkFlowy

- Easy drag and drop of bullet points
- Allow paragraph
- Show number of bullet points and sub bullet points inside a level
- Allow markdown
