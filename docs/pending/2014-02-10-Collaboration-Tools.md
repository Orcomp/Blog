Hare is a list of tools I use on a daily basis to collaborate with developers from around the world.

### TeamViewer

Tried a few different screen sharing applications, and find TeamViewer to be the fastest (very little lag).

Being able to quickly and effortlessly share your screen with another developer is the fastest way of getting work done.

### Trello
