Here are a few tips that make working with git a little easier.

This is more a reference to myself to find information quickly.

## Find Lost Commits

It is very easy to loose commits if you are working on a remote branch, then pull/checkout new updates.

Use this command to find dangling commits:

```
git fsck --lost-found
```

Then checkout the lost commits (```git checkout 6jdq32 ```) and create a branch for them so you don't loose it again.

## reflog

```
git reflog --all
```
